## Project Outline

Tales in Motion is a fictional organisation created for the sole purpose of creating an interactive website using JS, the primary focus of the website is to have the user play through an interactive tale that changes based on the users choices. Based on the users choices it would take you down a different narrative path with three seperate endings.

#### Key Objectives
 - A clear and easy to navigate website,
 - Responsive design that works effectively on all web sizes,
 - Color and imagery that matches the theme of the website,
 - Interactive website that clearly displays the story and intent,
 - Have the story be entertaining for specified audiences.

## UX Design

### User Stories

As a young adult reader, I want to make choices at key points in the story so that I can shape the narrative and experience a personalised adventure.

As a player, I want to choose how my character reacts in difficult situations so that I can influence their personal growth within the story.

As a user, I would like an easy to navigate website with information on how to play so that I can understand how to play. 

As a young adult, I want my choices to have real consequences on the world around me so that the story feels meaningful and my decisions matter.

As a player, I want the option to use my name for character interactions, so that it feels more personalised when other characters address me within the story.

### Colour Design

Color selection is a important part to any design and especially with this design, due to the fact it is primarily word based we need colours that compliment the text and aides in readability whilst not taking the users eyes away from the main centerpoint which is the game itself.

With that in mind we chose... INSERT COLOUR PALLETTE HERE! 

### Fonts

Fonts was another thing to consider when creating this website, the readibility as suggested in the last section is incredibly important.  

FONT 1 was used ... because ...

FONT 2 was used ... because ...
